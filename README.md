This term we began doing web part of our project. For the whole term we made design of our web-part, also we did HTML&CSS coding for designs we made. In the remaining part of the term we want and should do web logics by using JavaScript.
<h2>Design</h2>
We mainly made design for two pages - main page and authorization page.
Main page includes whole group and specific student statistics. Also it`s provides diagrams of these statistics.
Authorization page gives you opportunity to authorize:) Thats it
<h2>HTML&CSS coding</h2>
As already said we made coding for our designs. Those designs almost fully converted to adaptive coding, due to that you may use this web-service on any devices(PCs, tablets, smartphones)
<h2>Logics</h2>
In progress...
